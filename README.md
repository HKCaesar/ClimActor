# ClimActor

`ClimActor` is an `R` package created by the Data-Driven Envirolab team for the cleaning and preparation of subnational climate actors' names for further analysis. 
As more non-state (i.e., cities, regions, and companies) actors commit to climate action, new initiatives and databases recording such commitments have also become more 
commonplace. Many actors commit to multiple initiatives and appear in more than one database, yet appear across databases with slightly different names. This discrepancy 
makes data cleaning and wrangling more difficult than it should be and can result in over-counting of actorâ€™s climate commitments if not dealt with appropriately.


## Installation
The `ClimActor` package can be installed from github using the `install_github` function from devtools.
